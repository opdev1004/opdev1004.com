# Fast learning, preprocessing, intuitive website builder

## Quick Start
Getting started is as simple as:

```
With just one command, you can set up your project and start developing immediately.

## Why Choose Rino.js for Your Website?
Modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Next.js, Vue, and Nuxt have reshaped web app development, but they often come with challenges such as:

- Higher Costs: Increased expenses for hosting, traffic management, and maintenance.

Enter Rino.js. Built to simplify the process, Rino.js focuses on standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides:

Rino.js also offers flexibility: it allows you to integrate other frameworks like React or Vue when needed, keeping your project lightweight and manageable.
